# 👋 Hi, I'm Nima!

I'm a **medical doctor** with a strong passion for data science, particularly in the field of **medical data and radiology**. I combine my clinical background with technical skills in Python, data analysis, and machine learning to extract valuable insights from healthcare datasets.

I'm also a **professional guitarist**, which helps me keep my creativity flowing when I'm not coding or analyzing data.
